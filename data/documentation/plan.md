## üìù Action Log
- 2025-10-17 14:45Z ‚Äî Initialized Codex action log and reviewed existing battleplan to sync context.
- 2025-10-17 14:45Z ‚Äî Checked repository/global Git user identity; no name/email configured.
- 2025-10-17 14:48Z ‚Äî Staged all project files and created `Initial commit` on `main` for the new repository baseline.

## üéØ GOAL
Build a functional prototype that lets users:
1. Log **main lift + support exercises** (100+ catalog)
2. Compute **e1RM + volume** for the main lift
3. Get **AI coach feedback** (Arnie / Haf√æ√≥r / Ronnie) via Cloud Function
4. Persist sessions & show history
5. Guide users with an onboarding flow that captures **goals, experience, constraints**

- State management: Riverpod
- Backend: Firebase Auth (anonymous), Firestore, Firebase Functions (Node.js)
- Packages:
  ```
  firebase_core, firebase_auth, cloud_firestore, firebase_functions,

## üß≠ PRODUCT FLOW
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Onboarding (PROJECT PHYS style)
Guided questions:
- Goal: strength / hypertrophy / powerbuilding / unsure  
- Experience: novice / intermediate / advanced  
- Days per week: 2‚Äì6  
- Constraints: injuries / equipment / time  
- Main focus: Squat / Bench / Deadlift

Store ‚Üí `/users/{uid}/profile`

If info is missing, coaches may ask **one** clarifying question; never invent.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Logging
- Choose **Main Lift** (S / B / D)
- Add sets: kg, reps, RIR (optional)
- Add support exercises from 100+ catalog

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Summary
- Show e1RM (main lift) + total volume
- Button: **Get Coach Feedback**

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ History
- List of sessions ‚Üí detail view (sets, metrics, feedback)

## üß± DATA MODELS

### Profile
```json
/users/{uid}/profile {
  "goal": "strength" | "hypertrophy" | "powerbuilding" | "unsure",
  "experience": "novice" | "intermediate" | "advanced",
  "daysPerWeek": 2,
  "constraints": "optional string",
  "focus": "squat" | "bench" | "deadlift"
}
```

### Session
```json
/users/{uid}/sessions/{sessionId} {
  "startedAt": <Timestamp>,
  "endedAt": <Timestamp?>,
  "mode": "arnie" | "hafthor" | "ronnie",
  "mainLift": "squat" | "bench" | "deadlift",
  "mainLiftSets": [{ "kg": 150, "reps": 5, "rir": 1, "ts": 123456 }],
  "supports": [
    { "exerciseId": "barbell_row", "sets": [{ "kg": 80, "reps": 10 }] }
  ],
  "metrics": { "e1rmMain": 175.0, "volumeKg": 12450 },
  "coachFeedback": "text"
}
```

### Exercise Catalog
```json
/catalog/exercises/{exerciseId} {
  "name": "Barbell Back Squat (High-Bar)",
  "type": "compound",
  "modality": "barbell",
  "primary": ["quadriceps","glutes"],
  "secondary": ["core","spinal_erectors"],
  "tags": ["squat","barbell","compound"],
  "isMainLift": true,
  "equipment": ["rack","barbell","plates"],
  "defaultRepRange": [3,8]
}
```

## üìê CALCULATIONS
- **Epley Formula:** `e1RM = kg √ó (1 + reps / 30)`
- **e1RM (main)** = max Epley across mainLiftSets  
- **Volume** = sum of (kg √ó reps) for main + supports

---

## üîí FIRESTORE SECURITY (Rules)
```js
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /catalog/{document=**} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if false;
    }
    match /users/{userId}/{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```

## üß† AI COACH FUNCTION (`functions/coach`)
Callable Cloud Function: `coach`
- **Input:** `{ sessionId, mode }`
- **Auth required**
- Reads `/profile` + `/session`
- Summarizes ONLY existing data
- Sends prompt to OpenAI
- Saves `coachFeedback` ‚Üí Firestore
